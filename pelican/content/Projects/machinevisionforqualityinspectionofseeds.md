Summary: Development of a testing rig for my dissertation on a machine vision system for quality inspection of seeds.

A seed tape belt is moved on a track at a speed adjustable using a pot. Tension on the seed belt can be adjusted using the screws attached to the left drum. a piece of acrylic acts as a diffuser for the led strip. A camera is located above to perform machine vision on the seeds. The dissertation this was developed for can be located in the UWE Libraryâ€™s Content Collection Area of Blackboard.
